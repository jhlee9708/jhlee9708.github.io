Hi, I'm Juhyun Lee, PhD candidate at [KAIST EE](https://ee.kaist.ac.kr/) advised by [Prof. Jae-Woong Jeong](https://www.jeongresearch.org/).
I received BS in Electrical Engineering from KAIST in 2019.

My research focuses on developing neural interface to advance neuroscience and medicine.
I have extensive experience in system implementation based on microfabrication, circuit design, and embedded programming skills.

In the past, I developed a [wireless optogenetic neural probe](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41596-022-00758-8) and a [wireless EMG patch](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.adk5260).
Currently, I'm working on devices for various sensing modalities including electrical, chemical, and optical, which can be utilized for more comprehensive neuroscience research.
