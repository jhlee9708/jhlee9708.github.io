Hi, I'm Juhyun Lee, Ph.D candidate at [KAIST EE](https://ee.kaist.ac.kr/).

I'm working on ~~~ under the supervision of [Prof. Jae-Woong Jeong](https://www.jeongresearch.org/).

'Website not ready!'

Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/publications/) automatically.
